If your log file contains logs generated in multiple hours, please split the file
by hour and conduct robot detectionfor each file. Would've created a method as part
of algorithm to split files if time allows

run the algorith by running the command in terminal
>>> python3 main.py path_to_log_file
main.py
'123.45.67'
'111.111.11'
